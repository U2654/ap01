This repo contains the examples of the course Applied Programming I. 

The examples are sorted by programming language:
* *asm*: RISC-V assembly 
* *c/singles*: standalone C programs
* *py/singles*: standalone Python programs
* *js/singles*: standalone JavaScript programs
* *cs/*: C# console programs

The examples run within VS code. However...

To run the C# single examples, install and use [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). 

To run the JavaScript examples, install and use [node.js](https://nodejs.org). For example, to run filenname.js type in a terminal: 
```
node filename.js
```
