* *c/singles*: standalone C programs
* *py/singles*: standalone Python programs

The examples run within VS code. The installation of the following extensions for VS code are recommended:

* CodeLLDB
* C#
* C# Dev Kit
* IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit

Please open the leaf directories seperately as folder so that VS code applies the correct language. However... 

To run the C# single examples, install and use [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). 

To run the JavaScript examples, install and use [node.js](https://nodejs.org). And install prompt-sync: 
```
