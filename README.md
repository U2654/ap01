### This repo contains the examples of the course Applied Programming I. 

The examples are sorted by programming language:
* *asm*: RISC-V assembly 
* *c/singles*: standalone C programs
* *py/singles*: standalone Python programs
* *py/projects*: Python projects
* *js/singles*: standalone JavaScript programs
* *js/projects*: JavaScript projects
* *cs/*: C# console programs


### 1. Installation of Visual Studio Code:
(This should already have been done in the first lecture)
